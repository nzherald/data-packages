# Data packages

This is a meta repository that keeps track of data that the New Zealand Herald data journalism team has released.

This file was last modified on 28 May 2020 - if it is now much later than that then this list is probably stale.

There was a long gap in releasing packages here, for various reasons R data packages weren't the
best fit for what we were doing. But we have started again with
[nzhCovid19Docs](https://github.com/nzherald/nzhCovid19Docs).

The repository now also contains some of the scripts used to create the data packages (in the `src`)
directory. These rely on [DataPackageR](https://github.com/ropensci/DataPackageR).


## R Data Packages

Below is a list of all the R data packages we have released.
Each package resides in its own repository. This makes it slightly hard to 
keep track of the packages &mdash; hence this repository. But it means that
people can easily fork and modify a single package.
