# Data packages

This is a meta repository that keeps track of data that the New Zealand Herald data journalism team has released.

This file was last modified on 21 Sep 2018 - if it is now much later than that then this list is probably stale.

## R Data Packages

Below is a list of all the R data packages we have released.
Each package resides in its own repository. This makes it slightly hard to 
keep track of the packages &mdash; hence this repository. But it means that
people can easily fork and modify a single package.

schools from 2000 to 2017
